# Create Comprehensive Pull Request

This task guides the creation of a high-quality, comprehensive Pull Request description that helps reviewers understand all changes and speeds up the review process.

## Purpose

Create PR descriptions that:
- Document ALL work streams comprehensively
- Provide clear testing instructions
- Help reviewers focus on important areas
- Prevent tunnel vision through systematic analysis
- Make code review efficient and thorough

## Process

### 1. Comprehensive Scope Analysis (MANDATORY)

#### 1.1 Branch and Commit Analysis

Determine base branch and analyze all changes:
```bash
# Identify target branch (e.g., main, develop)
git branch --show-current

# Full commit analysis with details
git log <base_branch>..HEAD --stat --oneline

# Timeline of development
git log <base_branch>..HEAD --format="%h %ad %s" --date=short
```

Group commits by type:
- Features (feat)
- Bug fixes (fix)
- Documentation (docs)
- Refactoring (refactor)
- Tests (test)
- Maintenance (chore)

#### 1.2 File System Impact Analysis

```bash
# All file changes overview
git diff <base_branch>..HEAD --name-status

# Detailed diff statistics
git diff <base_branch>..HEAD --stat
```

Map changes to functional areas:
- **API/Backend**: Services, endpoints, business logic
- **UI/Frontend**: Components, styles, user interfaces
- **Documentation**: All *.md files, API docs, guides
- **Tests**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
- **Configuration**: Environment configs, build settings
- **Database**: Migrations, schema changes
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, deployment configs

#### 1.3 Work Stream Identification

Identify distinct work streams:
- **Primary**: Main feature or fix
- **Secondary**: Supporting changes
- **Cross-cutting**: Changes affecting multiple areas
- **Dependencies**: How streams relate to each other

### 2. Multi-Stream Narrative Synthesis

#### 2.1 Context and Motivation

For each work stream, establish:
- Problem being solved
- Current state vs. desired state
- Business/technical benefits
- Related issues or tickets

#### 2.2 Technical Implementation

Document for each work stream:
- Overall approach
- Architectural decisions
- Design patterns used
- Alternative solutions considered
- Technical trade-offs made

#### 2.3 Integration Points

Identify:
- How work streams integrate
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Backward compatibility measures
- Future extensibility

### 3. Review Instructions (Per Work Stream)

#### 3.1 Testing Instructions

**API Testing**:
- Endpoint URLs and methods
- Sample requests (curl/Postman)
- Expected responses
- Error scenarios
- Authentication requirements

**UI Testing**:
- User flows step-by-step
- Screenshots/GIFs (before/after)
- Browser compatibility notes
- Responsive design checks
- Accessibility verification

**Database Testing**:
- Migration commands
- Verification queries
- Rollback procedures
- Data integrity checks

**Configuration Testing**:
- Environment setup steps
- New variables/settings
- Deployment considerations

#### 3.2 Review Focus Areas

Highlight:
- Complex logic needing attention
- Security-sensitive changes
- Performance-critical code
- Breaking changes
- New patterns introduced

### 4. PR Description Template

```markdown
## Summary

[2-3 sentences explaining the PR's purpose and main achievement]

## Context

**Problem**: [What issue does this solve?]
**Solution**: [High-level approach taken]
**Impact**: [Who benefits and how?]

## Work Streams

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary: [Main Feature/Fix Name]
- **What**: [Brief description]
- **Files**: [Key files changed]
- **Impact**: [User/system impact]

### ðŸ”§ Secondary: [Supporting Changes]
- **What**: [Brief description]
- **Files**: [Key files changed]
- **Reason**: [Why needed]

## Technical Changes

### API Changes
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/resource` - Creates new resource
  - `GET /api/v1/resource/:id` - Retrieves resource
- **Modified Endpoints**:
  - `PUT /api/v1/existing` - Added field validation
- **Breaking Changes**: None

### UI Changes
- **New Components**:
  - `ResourceManager` - Main management interface
  - `ResourceForm` - Creation/edit form
- **Updated Components**:
  - `Dashboard` - Added resource widget
- **User Experience**:
  - Simplified workflow for resource creation
  - Added inline validation feedback

### Database Changes
- **Migrations**:
  - `001_add_resources_table.sql` - New resource storage
  - `002_add_resource_indexes.sql` - Performance indexes
- **Model Changes**:
  - Added Resource entity with relations

### Tests Added
- **Unit Tests**: 15 new tests for resource service
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint coverage
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflow validation

## Testing Instructions

### API Testing

1. Create a new resource:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/resource \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "Test Resource", "type": "example"}'
   ```
   Expected: 201 Created with resource ID

2. Retrieve the resource:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/resource/{id}
   ```
   Expected: 200 OK with resource data

### UI Testing

1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Click "Add Resource" button
3. Fill form with test data
4. Submit and verify success message
5. Check resource appears in list

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Verify migration success
SELECT * FROM schema_version ORDER BY installed_on DESC LIMIT 2;

-- Check data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM resources;
```

## Screenshots

### Before
[Dashboard without resource management]

### After
[Dashboard with new resource section]
[Resource creation form]
[Success state]
