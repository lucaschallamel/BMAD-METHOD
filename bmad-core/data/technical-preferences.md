# Technical Preferences and Architectural Principles

## Core Principles References

The following technical principles and standards apply to all BMAD projects:

### 1. Coding Standards
- **Reference:** `coding-standards.md`
- **Purpose:** Fundamental coding principles, security practices, and quality standards
- **Key Areas:** Code simplicity, dependency management, security, testing, commit standards

### 2. Twelve-Factor App Principles  
- **Reference:** `twelve-factor-principles.md`
- **Purpose:** Cloud-native application development principles
- **Key Areas:** Codebase management, dependencies, config, backing services, build/release/run

### 3. Microservice Patterns
- **Reference:** `microservice-patterns.md`
- **Purpose:** Patterns for distributed system architecture
- **Key Areas:** Service decomposition, communication patterns, data management, resilience

## Application Guidelines

1. **During Architecture Design:**
   - Apply twelve-factor principles for cloud-native applications
   - Consider microservice patterns for complex distributed systems
   - Document pattern choices in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

2. **During Implementation:**
   - Follow coding standards for all code generation
   - Apply security principles by default
   - Ensure testability and maintainability

3. **Technology Selection:**
   - Prefer simple, proven solutions over complex ones
   - Minimize dependencies unless explicitly justified
   - Consider operational complexity alongside technical capabilities
