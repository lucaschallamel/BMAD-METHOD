        Initialize AI session context:
        - Review Memory Bank if exists
        - Understand service architecture and dependencies
        - Check recent dev journals and ADRs
        - Review technical principles and patterns
        Required for new sessions or after 24+ hour gaps

    - agent: dev
      action: address_qa_feedback
      updates: implementation_files
      condition: qa_left_unchecked_items
      notes: |
        If QA left unchecked items:
        - Dev Agent (New Chat): Address remaining items
        - Return to QA for final approval

    - agent: dev
      creates: dev_journal_entry
      action: document_session_work
      uses: create-dev-journal
      condition: significant_work_completed
      notes: |
        Create dev journal for:
        - API changes and integration updates
        - Performance improvements

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Service enhancement requires coordinated stories
      - API versioning or breaking changes needed
      - Database schema changes required
      - Performance or scalability improvements needed
      - Multiple integration points affected
