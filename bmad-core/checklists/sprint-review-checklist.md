# Sprint Review Checklist

This checklist guides teams through conducting effective sprint reviews that capture achievements, learnings, and set up the next sprint for success.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - SPRINT REVIEW

Sprint Reviews are critical ceremonies for:
- Demonstrating completed work to stakeholders
- Capturing lessons learned
- Adjusting project direction based on feedback
- Planning upcoming work
- Updating project documentation

This checklist should be used:
- At the end of each sprint/iteration
- Before major milestone reviews
- When significant changes occur
- For handoffs between teams

The goal is to create a comprehensive record of progress and decisions.]]
