# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` â†’ Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` â†’ Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# review-story

When a developer agent marks a story as "Ready for Review", perform a comprehensive senior developer code review with the ability to refactor and improve code directly.

## Prerequisites

- Story status must be "Review"
- Developer has completed all tasks and updated the File List
- All automated tests are passing

## Review Process

1. **Read the Complete Story**
   - Review all acceptance criteria
   - Understand the dev notes and requirements
   - Note any completion notes from the developer

2. **Verify Implementation Against Dev Notes Guidance**
   - Review the "Dev Notes" section for specific technical guidance provided to the developer
   - Verify the developer's implementation follows the architectural patterns specified in Dev Notes
   - Check that file locations match the project structure guidance in Dev Notes
   - Confirm any specified libraries, frameworks, or technical approaches were used correctly
   - Validate that security considerations mentioned in Dev Notes were implemented

3. **Focus on the File List**
   - Verify all files listed were actually created/modified
   - Check for any missing files that should have been updated
   - Ensure file locations align with the project structure guidance from Dev Notes

4. **Senior Developer Code Review**
   - Review code with the eye of a senior developer
   - If changes form a cohesive whole, review them together
   - If changes are independent, review incrementally file by file
   - Focus on:
     - Code architecture and design patterns
     - Refactoring opportunities
     - Code duplication or inefficiencies
     - Performance optimizations
     - Security concerns
     - Best practices and patterns

5. **Active Refactoring**
   - As a senior developer, you CAN and SHOULD refactor code where improvements are needed
   - When refactoring:
     - Make the changes directly in the files
     - Explain WHY you're making the change
     - Describe HOW the change improves the code
     - Ensure all tests still pass after refactoring
     - Update the File List if you modify additional files

6. **Standards Compliance Check**
   - Verify adherence to `docs/coding-standards.md`
   - Check compliance with `docs/unified-project-structure.md`
   - Validate testing approach against `docs/testing-strategy.md`
   - Ensure all guidelines mentioned in the story are followed

7. **Acceptance Criteria Validation**
   - Verify each AC is fully implemented
   - Check for any missing functionality
   - Validate edge cases are handled

8. **Test Coverage Review**
   - Ensure unit tests cover edge cases
   - Add missing tests if critical coverage is lacking
   - Verify integration tests (if required) are comprehensive
   - Check that test assertions are meaningful
   - Look for missing test scenarios

9. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Verify code is self-documenting where possible
   - Add comments for complex logic if missing
   - Ensure any API changes are documented

## Update Story File - QA Results Section ONLY

**CRITICAL**: You are ONLY authorized to update the "QA Results" section of the story file. DO NOT modify any other sections.

After review and any refactoring, append your results to the story file in the QA Results section:

```markdown
## QA Results

# Coding Standards and Principles

> **Purpose:** This document defines the core coding standards and principles that apply to all development work in BMAD projects. These are fundamental rules of software craftsmanship that ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability.

## Core Coding Principles

### Simplicity and Readability
- **[SF] Simplicity First:** Always choose the simplest viable solution. Complex patterns require explicit justification.
- **[RP] Readability Priority:** Code must be immediately understandable by both humans and AI.
- **[CA] Clean Architecture:** Generate cleanly formatted, logically structured code with consistent patterns.

### Dependency Management
- **[DM] Dependency Minimalism:** No new libraries without explicit request or compelling justification.
- **[DM-1] Security Reviews:** Review third-party dependencies for vulnerabilities quarterly.
- **[DM-2] Package Verification:** Prefer signed or verified packages.
- **[DM-3] Cleanup:** Remove unused or outdated dependencies promptly.
- **[DM-4] Documentation:** Document dependency updates in changelog.

### Development Workflow
- **[WF-FOCUS] Task Focus:** Focus on areas of code relevant to the task.
- **[WF-SCOPE] Scope Control:** Do not touch code unrelated to the task.
- **[WF-TEST] Testing:** Write thorough tests for all major functionality.
- **[WF-ARCH] Architecture Stability:** Avoid major changes to working patterns unless explicitly requested.
- **[WF-IMPACT] Impact Analysis:** Consider effects on other methods and code areas.

### Code Quality Standards
- **[DRY] DRY Principle:** No duplicate code. Reuse or extend existing functionality.
- **[REH] Error Handling:** Robust error handling for all edge cases and external interactions.
- **[CSD] Code Smell Detection:** Proactively identify and refactor:
  - Functions exceeding 30 lines
  - Files exceeding 300 lines
  - Nested conditionals beyond 2 levels
  - Classes with more than 5 public methods

### Security Principles
- **[IV] Input Validation:** All external data must be validated before processing.
- **[SFT] Security-First:** Implement proper authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **[RL] Rate Limiting:** Rate limit all API endpoints.
- **[RLS] Row-Level Security:** Use row-level security always.
- **[CAP] Captcha Protection:** Captcha on all auth routes/signup pages.
- **[WAF] WAF Protection:** Enable attack challenge on hosting WAF when available.
- **[SEC-1] Sensitive Files:** DO NOT read or modify without prior approval:
  - .env files
  - */config/secrets.*
  - Any file containing API keys or credentials

### Performance and Resources
- **[PA] Performance Awareness:** Consider computational complexity and resource usage.
- **[RM] Resource Management:** Close connections and free resources appropriately.
- **[CMV] Constants Over Magic Values:** No magic strings or numbers. Use named constants.

### Commit Standards
- **[AC] Atomic Changes:** Make small, self-contained modifications.
- **[CD] Commit Discipline:** Use conventional commit format:
  ```
  type(scope): concise description
  
  [optional body with details]
  
  [optional footer with breaking changes/issue references]
  ```
  Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore

### Testing Standards
- **[TDT] Test-Driven Thinking:** Design all code to be easily testable from inception.
- **[ISA] Industry Standards:** Follow established conventions for the language and tech stack.

## Application to AI Development

### Communication Guidelines
- **[RAT] Rule Application Tracking:** Tag rule applications with abbreviations (e.g., [SF], [DRY]).
- **[EDC] Explanation Depth Control:** Scale explanation detail based on complexity.
- **[AS] Alternative Suggestions:** Offer alternative approaches with pros/cons when relevant.
- **[KBT] Knowledge Boundary Transparency:** Clearly communicate capability limits.

### Context Management
- **[TR] Transparent Reasoning:** Explicitly reference which rules influenced decisions.
- **[CWM] Context Window Management:** Be mindful of AI context limitations.
- **[SD] Strategic Documentation:** Comment only complex logic or critical functions.

## Integration with BMAD Workflows

These coding standards should be:
1. Referenced during architecture design decisions
2. Applied during story implementation
3. Validated during code reviews
4. Enforced through automated tooling where possible
5. Updated based on team learnings and retrospectives

==================== START: .bmad-core/data/twelve-factor-principles.md ====================
# Twelve-Factor App Principles

> **Purpose:** This document provides the definitive set of rules based on the Twelve-Factor App methodology. These principles are mandatory for ensuring applications are built as scalable, resilient, and maintainable cloud-native services.

## The Twelve Factors

### I. Codebase
- A single, version-controlled codebase must represent one application
- All code for a specific application belongs to this single codebase
- Shared functionality must be factored into versioned libraries
- One codebase produces multiple deploys (development, staging, production)

### II. Dependencies
- Explicitly declare all dependencies via manifest files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt)
- Never rely on implicit existence of system-wide packages
- Application must run in isolated environment with only declared dependencies

### III. Config
- Strict separation between code and configuration
- All deploy-varying config must be read from environment variables
- Never hardcode environment-specific values in source code
- Codebase must be runnable anywhere with correct environment variables

### IV. Backing Services
- Treat all backing services as attached, swappable resources
- Connect via locators/credentials stored in environment variables
- Code must be agnostic to whether service is local or third-party
- Examples: databases, message queues, caches, external APIs

### V. Build, Release, Run
Maintain strict three-stage separation:
- **Build:** Convert code repo into executable bundle
- **Release:** Combine build with environment-specific config
- **Run:** Execute release in target environment
- Releases must be immutable with unique IDs
- Any change requires new release

### VI. Processes
- Execute as stateless, share-nothing processes
- Persistent data must be stored in stateful backing service
- Never assume local memory/disk state available across requests
- Process state is ephemeral

### VII. Port Binding
- Application must be self-contained
- Export services by binding to port specified via configuration
- Do not rely on runtime injection of webserver
- Application brings its own webserver library

### VIII. Concurrency
- Scale out horizontally by adding concurrent processes
- Assign different workload types to different process types
- Use process manager for lifecycle management
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start

### IX. Disposability
- Processes must be disposable (start/stop quickly)
- Minimize startup time for fast elastic scaling
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM
- Robust against sudden death (crash-only design)

### X. Dev/Prod Parity
Keep environments as similar as possible:
- Same programming language versions
- Same system tooling
- Same backing service types and versions
- Minimize time, personnel, and tool gaps

### XI. Logs
- Treat logs as event streams
- Never write to or manage log files directly
- Write unbuffered to stdout
- Execution environment handles collection and routing

### XII. Admin Processes
- Run admin tasks as one-off processes
- Use identical environment as long-running processes
- Ship admin scripts with application code
- Use same dependency and config management

## Additional Cloud-Native Principles

### Containerization
- **[SVC] Service as Container:** Package services as container images
- Encapsulate technology stack in containers
- Ensure consistent deployment across environments

### Serverless Options
- **[SRL] Serverless Deployment:** Consider serverless platforms when appropriate
- Abstract away infrastructure management
- Focus on business logic over infrastructure

### Observability
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and metrics
- Use distributed tracing for microservices
- Ensure all services are observable by default

### Security
- Security must be built-in, not bolted-on
- Use principle of least privilege
- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security audits and updates

## AI/Agent Safeguards
- All AI-generated code must be reviewed before production
- Escalate ambiguous or risky decisions for approval
- Log all significant AI-suggested changes
- Never overwrite .env files without confirmation

## Environmental Sustainability
- Optimize compute resources
- Minimize infrastructure waste
- Prefer energy-efficient solutions
- Consider environmental impact in technical decisions

## Integration with BMAD

These principles should be:
1. Applied during architecture design
2. Validated during implementation
3. Enforced through CI/CD pipelines
4. Reviewed during architectural decision records (ADRs)
5. Considered in all technical decisions
