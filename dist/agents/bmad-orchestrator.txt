# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Advanced Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of ideas through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple analytical perspectives
- Usable during template-driven document creation or any chat conversation

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Template Document Creation

After outputting a section during document creation:

1. **Section Review**: Ask user to review the drafted section
2. **Offer Elicitation**: Present 9 carefully selected elicitation methods
3. **Simple Selection**: User types a number (0-8) to engage method, or 9 to proceed
4. **Execute & Loop**: Apply selected method, then re-offer choices until user proceeds

### Scenario 2: General Chat Elicitation

User can request advanced elicitation on any agent output:

- User says "do advanced elicitation" or similar
- Agent selects 9 relevant methods for the context
- Same simple 0-9 selection process

## Task Instructions

### 1. Intelligent Method Selection

**Context Analysis**: Before presenting options, analyze:

- **Content Type**: Technical specs, user stories, architecture, requirements, etc.
- **Complexity Level**: Simple, moderate, or complex content
- **Stakeholder Needs**: Who will use this information
- **Risk Level**: High-impact decisions vs routine items
- **Creative Potential**: Opportunities for innovation or alternatives

**Method Selection Strategy**:

1. **Always Include Core Methods** (choose 3-4):
   - Expand or Contract for Audience
   - Critique and Refine
   - Identify Potential Risks
   - Assess Alignment with Goals

2. **Context-Specific Methods** (choose 4-5):
   - **Technical Content**: Tree of Thoughts, ReWOO, Meta-Prompting
   - **User-Facing Content**: Agile Team Perspective, Stakeholder Roundtable
   - **Creative Content**: Innovation Tournament, Escape Room Challenge
   - **Strategic Content**: Red Team vs Blue Team, Hindsight Reflection

3. **Always Include**: "Proceed / No Further Actions" as option 9

### 2. Section Context and Review

When invoked after outputting a section:

1. **Provide Context Summary**: Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented

2. **Explain Visual Elements**: If the section contains diagrams, explain them briefly before offering elicitation options

3. **Clarify Scope Options**: If the section contains multiple distinct items, inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)

### 3. Present Elicitation Options

**Review Request Process:**

- Ask the user to review the drafted section
- In the SAME message, inform them they can suggest direct changes OR select an elicitation method
- Present 9 intelligently selected methods (0-8) plus "Proceed" (9)
- Keep descriptions short - just the method name
- Await simple numeric selection

**Action List Presentation Format:**

```text
**Advanced Elicitation Options**
Choose a number (0-8) or 9 to proceed:

0. [Method Name]
1. [Method Name]
2. [Method Name]
3. [Method Name]
4. [Method Name]
5. [Method Name]
6. [Method Name]
7. [Method Name]
8. [Method Name]
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

**Response Handling:**

- **Numbers 0-8**: Execute the selected method, then re-offer the choice
- **Number 9**: Proceed to next section or continue conversation
- **Direct Feedback**: Apply user's suggested changes and continue

### 4. Method Execution Framework

**Execution Process:**

1. **Retrieve Method**: Access the specific elicitation method from the elicitation-methods data file
2. **Apply Context**: Execute the method from your current role's perspective
3. **Provide Results**: Deliver insights, critiques, or alternatives relevant to the content
4. **Re-offer Choice**: Present the same 9 options again until user selects 9 or gives direct feedback

**Execution Guidelines:**

- **Be Concise**: Focus on actionable insights, not lengthy explanations
- **Stay Relevant**: Tie all elicitation back to the specific content being analyzed
- **Identify Personas**: For multi-persona methods, clearly identify which viewpoint is speaking
- **Maintain Flow**: Keep the process moving efficiently

# Create Document from Template (YAML Driven)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each section must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Complete documents cannot be created without following this workflow

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete document without user interaction, you have violated this workflow.

## Critical: Template Discovery

If a YAML Template has not been provided, list all templates from .bmad-core/templates or ask the user to provide another.

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Elicitation Format

**When `elicit: true`, this is a HARD STOP requiring user interaction:**

**YOU MUST:**

1. Present section content
2. Provide detailed rationale (explain trade-offs, assumptions, decisions made)
3. **STOP and present numbered options 1-9:**
   - **Option 1:** Always "Proceed to next section"
   - **Options 2-9:** Select 8 methods from data/elicitation-methods
   - End with: "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"
4. **WAIT FOR USER RESPONSE** - Do not proceed until user selects option or provides feedback

**WORKFLOW VIOLATION:** Creating content for elicit=true sections without user interaction violates this task.

**NEVER ask yes/no questions or use any other format.**

## Processing Flow

1. **Parse YAML template** - Load template metadata and sections
2. **Set preferences** - Show current mode (Interactive), confirm output file
3. **Process each section:**
   - Skip if condition unmet
   - Check agent permissions (owner/editors) - note if section is restricted to specific agents
   - Draft content using section instruction
   - Present content + detailed rationale
   - **IF elicit: true** → MANDATORY 1-9 options format
   - Save to file if possible
4. **Continue until complete**

## Detailed Rationale Requirements

When presenting section content, ALWAYS include rationale that explains:

- Trade-offs and choices made (what was chosen over alternatives and why)
- Key assumptions made during drafting
- Interesting or questionable decisions that need user attention
- Areas that might need validation

## Elicitation Results Flow

After user selects elicitation method (2-9):

1. Execute method from data/elicitation-methods
2. Present results with insights
3. Offer options:
   - **1. Apply changes and update section**
   - **2. Return to elicitation menu**
   - **3. Ask any questions or engage further with this elicitation**

## Agent Permissions

When processing sections with agent permission fields:

- **owner**: Note which agent role initially creates/populates the section
- **editors**: List agent roles allowed to modify the section
- **readonly**: Mark sections that cannot be modified after creation

**For sections with restricted access:**

- Include a note in the generated document indicating the responsible agent
- Example: "_(This section is owned by dev-agent and can only be modified by dev-agent)_"

## YOLO Mode

User can type `#yolo` to toggle to YOLO mode (process all sections at once).

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**❌ NEVER:**

- Ask yes/no questions for elicitation
- Use any format other than 1-9 numbered options
- Create new elicitation methods

**✅ ALWAYS:**

- Use exact 1-9 format when elicit: true
- Select options 2-9 from data/elicitation-methods only
- Provide detailed rationale explaining decisions
- End with "Select 1-9 or just type your question/feedback:"

# Initialize Memory Bank

This task creates and initializes the Memory Bank structure for maintaining context across AI sessions. The Memory Bank ensures continuity and deep understanding of the project even when AI memory resets.

## Purpose

The Memory Bank serves as persistent memory for AI agents, containing:
- Project foundation and goals
- Current work context
- System architecture and patterns
- Technical decisions and constraints
- Progress tracking

## Initial Setup

### 1. Create Directory Structure

[[LLM: The Memory Bank location follows the standard defined in project-scaffolding-preference.md]]

```bash
mkdir -p docs/memory-bank
```

### 2. Determine Initialization Type

Ask the user:
- Is this a new project? → Create from scratch
- Is this an existing project? → Analyze and populate
- Do you have existing documentation? → Import and adapt

### 3. Create Core Memory Bank Files

The Memory Bank consists of 6 core files that build upon each other:

#### 3.1 Project Brief (`projectbrief.md`)
Foundation document - the source of truth for project scope:
- Core requirements and goals
- Project vision and objectives
- Success criteria
- Constraints and boundaries

**Note**: Use `project-brief-tmpl.yaml` template in **Memory Bank mode** to generate this file. This ensures compatibility with both standalone project briefs and Memory Bank integration.

#### 3.2 Product Context (`productContext.md`)
The "why" behind the project:
- Problems being solved
- User needs and pain points
- Expected outcomes
- User experience goals

#### 3.3 System Patterns (`systemPatterns.md`)
Technical architecture and decisions:
- System architecture overview
- Key design patterns
- Component relationships
- Integration points
- Critical implementation paths

#### 3.4 Tech Context (`techContext.md`)
Technology stack and environment:
- Languages and frameworks
- Development tools
- Dependencies and versions
- Technical constraints
- Build and deployment

#### 3.5 Active Context (`activeContext.md`)
Current work focus:
- Active work items
- Recent changes
- Current decisions
- Next priorities
- Open questions

#### 3.6 Progress (`progress.md`)
Project state tracking:
- Completed features
- Work in progress
- Known issues
- Technical debt
- Evolution of decisions

## Process

### For New Projects

1. **Gather Project Information**
   - Interview user about project goals
   - Understand target users
   - Define success criteria
   - Identify constraints

2. **Create Initial Files**
   - Start with projectbrief.md
   - Populate product context
   - Define initial architecture
   - Document tech stack
   - Set initial active context
   - Initialize progress tracking

### For Existing Projects

1. **Analyze Current State**
   ```bash
   # Review existing documentation
   - README files
   - Architecture docs
   - ADRs
   - Dev journals
   - Changelogs
   ```

2. **Extract Key Information**
   - Project purpose and goals
   - Current architecture
   - Technology decisions
   - Recent work
   - Known issues

3. **Populate Memory Bank**
   - Synthesize findings into 6 core files
   - Maintain accuracy to reality
   - Document technical debt
   - Capture current priorities

### 4. Validation

After creating initial files:
1. Review with user for accuracy
2. Ensure consistency across files
3. Verify no critical information missing
4. Confirm next steps are clear

## Templates

Use the memory bank templates from `bmad-core/templates/`:

# Create Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

This task guides the creation of an ADR to document significant architectural decisions.

## Initial Setup (if needed)

[[LLM: The ADR location follows the standard defined in project-scaffolding-preference.md]]

If the /docs/adr directory doesn't exist in the project:
1. Create the directory: `mkdir -p docs/adr`
2. Create a README.md explaining ADR purpose and structure
3. Create an index file to track all ADRs
4. Add to git tracking

## Process

### 1. Determine ADR Number

Check existing ADRs to determine the next number:
```bash
ls docs/adr/[0-9]*.md | tail -1
```

Format: NNNN (four digits, e.g., 0001, 0002)

### 2. Validate Need for ADR

Confirm this decision warrants an ADR by checking against triggers:
- Major technology choices (frameworks, databases, languages)
- Significant architectural patterns or styles
- Integration approaches between systems
- Security architecture decisions
- Performance optimization strategies

### 3. Gather Context

Before creating the ADR, collect:
- The problem or issue motivating this decision
- Technical and business constraints
- Alternative solutions considered
- Stakeholders involved in the decision

### 4. Create ADR File

Use the adr-tmpl.yaml template to create:
`docs/adr/NNNN-descriptive-title.md`

Example: `0001-use-react-for-frontend.md`

### 5. Fill Out Sections

Complete all sections of the ADR:
- **Status**: Start with "Proposed"
- **Context**: Neutral description of the situation
- **Decision**: Clear statement starting with "We will..."
- **Alternatives**: At least 3 options with pros/cons
- **Consequences**: Both positive and negative
- **Implementation**: Concrete next steps

### 6. Review and Finalize

- Ensure technical accuracy
- Verify all alternatives were fairly considered
- Check that consequences are realistic
- Update ADR index with new entry

### 7. Link Related ADRs

If this decision:
- Supersedes another ADR, update both files
- Relates to other decisions, add cross-references
- Changes previous decisions, note the evolution

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Problem clearly stated
- [ ] Alternatives fairly evaluated
- [ ] Decision explicitly stated
- [ ] Consequences documented (positive and negative)
- [ ] Implementation steps defined
- [ ] Proper numbering and naming
- [ ] Index updated
- [ ] Related ADRs linked

## Memory Bank Integration

After creating an ADR:
1. Update `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with the architectural decision
2. If technology stack changed, update `docs/memory-bank/techContext.md`
3. Update `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md` with the decision context
4. Consider running `update-memory-bank` task for comprehensive update

## Process

### 1. Gather Session Context

First, collect the following information:
- Current git branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Session timeframe (when work started and ended)
- Recent commits: `git log --since="[session-start]" --oneline`
- Changed files: `git status --porcelain`

### 2. Determine Entry Filename

Create filename using pattern: `YYYYMMDD-NN.md`
- YYYYMMDD: Today's date
- NN: Sequential number (01, 02, etc.) if multiple entries per day

Check existing entries: `ls docs/devJournal/YYYYMMDD-*.md`

### 3. Create Journal Entry

Use the dev-journal-tmpl.yaml template to create a comprehensive entry covering:

#### Essential Sections
1. **Session Overview** - Brief summary of accomplishments
2. **Work Streams** - Detailed breakdown of each area of work
3. **Implementation Details** - Key code changes and decisions
4. **Validation & Testing** - What was tested and verified
5. **Current State & Next Steps** - Where we are and what's next

**Sprint Journal Entries**: For end-of-sprint dev journal entries, cross-reference with `sprint-review-checklist.md` to ensure all sprint accomplishments and learnings are captured.

#### Evidence Gathering
- Review all commits made during session
- Check modified files by functional area
- Note any new patterns or architectural decisions
- Document challenges encountered and solutions found

### 4. Quality Checks

Before finalizing, ensure:
- [ ] All work streams are documented
- [ ] Technical decisions are explained

### 5. Save and Review

- Save to: `/docs/devJournal/YYYYMMDD-NN.md`
- Review for completeness and clarity
- Ensure future developers can understand the session's impact

## Tips

- Focus on the "why" behind changes, not just "what"
- Document both successes and challenges
- Include enough detail for context without overwhelming
- Cross-reference related stories, ADRs, or PRs
- Use British English for consistency
- For sprint-end entries, ensure alignment with sprint review documentation using `sprint-review-checklist.md`

## Memory Bank Integration

After creating a dev journal entry:
1. Update `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md` with current work and decisions
2. Update `docs/memory-bank/progress.md` with completed features and status
3. If patterns or insights discovered, update `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
4. Consider running `update-memory-bank` task for comprehensive update

This ensures AI agents in future sessions have access to session context and learnings.

# BMad Knowledge Base

## Overview

BMad-Method (Breakthrough Method of Agile AI-driven Development) is a framework that combines AI agents with Agile development methodologies. The v4 system introduces a modular architecture with improved dependency management, bundle optimization, and support for both web and IDE environments.

### Key Features

- **Modular Agent System**: Specialized AI agents for each Agile role
- **Build System**: Automated dependency resolution and optimization
- **Dual Environment Support**: Optimized for both web UIs and IDEs
- **Reusable Resources**: Portable templates, tasks, and checklists
- **Slash Command Integration**: Quick agent switching and control

### When to Use BMad

- **New Projects (Greenfield)**: Complete end-to-end development
- **Existing Projects (Brownfield)**: Feature additions and enhancements
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple roles working together
- **Quality Assurance**: Structured testing and validation
- **Documentation**: Professional PRDs, architecture docs, user stories

## How BMad Works

### The Core Method

BMad transforms you into a "Vibe CEO" - directing a team of specialized AI agents through structured workflows. Here's how:

1. **You Direct, AI Executes**: You provide vision and decisions; agents handle implementation details
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent masters one role (PM, Developer, Architect, etc.)
3. **Structured Workflows**: Proven patterns guide you from idea to deployed code
4. **Clean Handoffs**: Fresh context windows ensure agents stay focused and effective

### The Two-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Planning (Web UI - Cost Effective)

- Use large context windows (Gemini's 1M tokens)
- Generate comprehensive documents (PRD, Architecture)
- Leverage multiple agents for brainstorming
- Create once, use throughout development

#### Phase 2: Development (IDE - Implementation)

- Shard documents into manageable pieces
- Execute focused SM → Dev cycles
- One story at a time, sequential progress
- Real-time file operations and testing

### The Development Loop

```text
1. SM Agent (New Chat) → Creates next story from sharded docs
2. You → Review and approve story
3. Dev Agent (New Chat) → Implements approved story
4. QA Agent (New Chat) → Reviews and refactors code
5. You → Verify completion
6. Repeat until epic complete
```

### Why This Works

- **Context Optimization**: Clean chats = better AI performance
- **Role Clarity**: Agents don't context-switch = higher quality
- **Incremental Progress**: Small stories = manageable complexity
- **Human Oversight**: You validate each step = quality control
- **Document-Driven**: Specs guide everything = consistency

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Options

#### Option 1: Web UI

**Best for**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini users who want to start immediately

1. Navigate to `dist/teams/`
2. Copy `team-fullstack.txt` content
3. Create new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
4. Upload file with instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
5. Type `/help` to see available commands

#### Option 2: IDE Integration

**Best for**: Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Trae, Cline, Roo Code, Github Copilot users

```bash
# Interactive installation (recommended)
npx bmad-method install
```

**Installation Steps**:

- Choose "Complete installation"
- Select your IDE from supported options:
  - **Cursor**: Native AI integration
  - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official IDE
  - **Windsurf**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Trae**: Built-in AI capabilities
  - **Cline**: VS Code extension with AI features
  - **Roo Code**: Web-based IDE with agent support
  - **GitHub Copilot**: VS Code extension with AI peer programming assistant

**Note for VS Code Users**: BMad-Method assumes when you mention "VS Code" that you're using it with an AI-powered extension like GitHub Copilot, Cline, or Roo. Standard VS Code without AI capabilities cannot run BMad agents. The installer includes built-in support for Cline and Roo.

**Verify Installation**:

- `.bmad-core/` folder created with all agents
- IDE-specific integration files created
- All agent commands/rules/modes available

**Remember**: At its core, BMad-Method is about mastering and harnessing prompt engineering. Any IDE with AI agent support can use BMad - the framework provides the structured prompts and workflows that make AI development effective

### Environment Selection Guide

**Use Web UI for**:

- Initial planning and documentation (PRD, architecture)
- Cost-effective document creation (especially with Gemini)
- Brainstorming and analysis phases
- Multi-agent consultation and planning

**Use IDE for**:

- Active development and coding
- File operations and project integration
- Document sharding and story management
- Implementation workflow (SM/Dev cycles)

**Cost-Saving Tip**: Create large documents (PRDs, architecture) in web UI, then copy to `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` in your project before switching to IDE for development.

### IDE-Only Workflow Considerations

**Can you do everything in IDE?** Yes, but understand the tradeoffs:

**Pros of IDE-Only**:

- Single environment workflow
- Direct file operations from start
- No copy/paste between environments
- Immediate project integration

**Cons of IDE-Only**:

- Higher token costs for large document creation
- Smaller context windows (varies by IDE/model)
- May hit limits during planning phases
- Less cost-effective for brainstorming

**Using Web Agents in IDE**:

- **NOT RECOMMENDED**: Web agents (PM, Architect) have rich dependencies designed for large contexts
- **Why it matters**: Dev agents are kept lean to maximize coding context
- **The principle**: "Dev agents code, planning agents plan" - mixing breaks this optimization

**About bmad-master and bmad-orchestrator**:

- **bmad-master**: CAN do any task without switching agents, BUT...
- **Still use specialized agents for planning**: PM, Architect, and UX Expert have tuned personas that produce better results
- **Why specialization matters**: Each agent's personality and focus creates higher quality outputs
- **If using bmad-master/orchestrator**: Fine for planning phases, but...

**CRITICAL RULE for Development**:

- **ALWAYS use SM agent for story creation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **ALWAYS use Dev agent for implementation** - Never use bmad-master or bmad-orchestrator
- **Why this matters**: SM and Dev agents are specifically optimized for the development workflow
- **No exceptions**: Even if using bmad-master for everything else, switch to SM → Dev for implementation

**Best Practice for IDE-Only**:

1. Use PM/Architect/UX agents for planning (better than bmad-master)
2. Create documents directly in project
3. Shard immediately after creation
4. **MUST switch to SM agent** for story creation
5. **MUST switch to Dev agent** for implementation
6. Keep planning and coding in separate chat sessions

## Core Configuration (core-config.yaml)

**New in V4**: The `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` file is a critical innovation that enables BMad to work seamlessly with any project structure, providing maximum flexibility and backwards compatibility.

### What is core-config.yaml?

This configuration file acts as a map for BMad agents, telling them exactly where to find your project documents and how they're structured. It enables:

- **Version Flexibility**: Work with V3, V4, or custom document structures
- **Custom Locations**: Define where your documents and shards live
- **Developer Context**: Specify which files the dev agent should always load
- **Debug Support**: Built-in logging for troubleshooting

### Key Configuration Areas

#### PRD Configuration

- **prdVersion**: Tells agents if PRD follows v3 or v4 conventions
- **prdSharded**: Whether epics are embedded (false) or in separate files (true)
- **prdShardedLocation**: Where to find sharded epic files
- **epicFilePattern**: Pattern for epic filenames (e.g., `epic-{n}*.md`)

#### Architecture Configuration

- **architectureVersion**: v3 (monolithic) or v4 (sharded)
- **architectureSharded**: Whether architecture is split into components
- **architectureShardedLocation**: Where sharded architecture files live

#### Developer Files

- **devLoadAlwaysFiles**: List of files the dev agent loads for every task
- **devDebugLog**: Where dev agent logs repeated failures
- **agentCoreDump**: Export location for chat conversations

### Why It Matters

1. **No Forced Migrations**: Keep your existing document structure
2. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with V3 and migrate to V4 at your pace
3. **Custom Workflows**: Configure BMad to match your team's process
4. **Intelligent Agents**: Agents automatically adapt to your configuration

### Common Configurations

**Legacy V3 Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v3
prdSharded: false
architectureVersion: v3
architectureSharded: false
```

**V4 Optimized Project**:

```yaml
prdVersion: v4
prdSharded: true
prdShardedLocation: docs/prd
architectureVersion: v4
architectureSharded: true
architectureShardedLocation: docs/architecture
```

## Core Philosophy

### Vibe CEO'ing

You are the "Vibe CEO" - thinking like a CEO with unlimited resources and a singular vision. Your AI agents are your high-powered team, and your role is to:

- **Direct**: Provide clear instructions and objectives
- **Refine**: Iterate on outputs to achieve quality
- **Oversee**: Maintain strategic alignment across all agents

### Core Principles

1. **MAXIMIZE_AI_LEVERAGE**: Push the AI to deliver more. Challenge outputs and iterate.
2. **QUALITY_CONTROL**: You are the ultimate arbiter of quality. Review all outputs.
3. **STRATEGIC_OVERSIGHT**: Maintain the high-level vision and ensure alignment.
4. **ITERATIVE_REFINEMENT**: Expect to revisit steps. This is not a linear process.
5. **CLEAR_INSTRUCTIONS**: Precise requests lead to better outputs.
6. **DOCUMENTATION_IS_KEY**: Good inputs (briefs, PRDs) lead to good outputs.
7. **START_SMALL_SCALE_FAST**: Test concepts, then expand.
8. **EMBRACE_THE_CHAOS**: Adapt and overcome challenges.

### Key Workflow Principles

1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Always start fresh when switching between agents
3. **Status Tracking**: Maintain story statuses (Draft → Approved → InProgress → Done)
4. **Iterative Development**: Complete one story before starting the next
5. **Documentation First**: Always start with solid PRD and architecture

### Agent Interaction Commands

#### IDE-Specific Syntax

**Agent Loading by IDE**:

- **Claude Code**: `/agent-name` (e.g., `/bmad-master`)
- **Cursor**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Windsurf**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Trae**: `@agent-name` (e.g., `@bmad-master`)
- **Roo Code**: Select mode from mode selector (e.g., `bmad-master`)
- **GitHub Copilot**: Open the Chat view (`⌃⌘I` on Mac, `Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows/Linux) and select **Agent** from the chat mode selector.

**Chat Management Guidelines**:

- **Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Trae**: Start new chats when switching agents
- **Roo Code**: Switch modes within the same conversation

**Common Task Commands**:

- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*status` - Show current context/progress

## Core Architecture

### System Overview

The BMad-Method is built around a modular architecture centered on the `bmad-core` directory, which serves as the brain of the entire system. This design enables the framework to operate effectively in both IDE environments (like Cursor, VS Code) and web-based AI interfaces (like ChatGPT, Gemini).

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Agents (`bmad-core/agents/`)

- **Purpose**: Each markdown file defines a specialized AI agent for a specific Agile role (PM, Dev, Architect, etc.)
- **Structure**: Contains YAML headers specifying the agent's persona, capabilities, and dependencies
- **Dependencies**: Lists of tasks, templates, checklists, and data files the agent can use
- **Startup Instructions**: Can load project-specific documentation for immediate context

#### 2. Agent Teams (`bmad-core/agent-teams/`)

- **Purpose**: Define collections of agents bundled together for specific purposes
- **Examples**: `team-all.yaml` (comprehensive bundle), `team-fullstack.yaml` (full-stack development)
- **Usage**: Creates pre-packaged contexts for web UI environments

#### 3. Workflows (`bmad-core/workflows/`)

- **Purpose**: YAML files defining prescribed sequences of steps for specific project types
- **Types**: Greenfield (new projects) and Brownfield (existing projects) for UI, service, and fullstack development
- **Structure**: Defines agent interactions, artifacts created, and transition conditions

#### 4. Reusable Resources

- **Templates** (`bmad-core/templates/`): Markdown templates for PRDs, architecture specs, user stories
- **Tasks** (`bmad-core/tasks/`): Instructions for specific repeatable actions like "shard-doc" or "create-next-story"
- **Checklists** (`bmad-core/checklists/`): Quality assurance checklists for validation and review
- **Data** (`bmad-core/data/`): Core knowledge base, technical preferences, and project scaffolding guidelines

### Dual Environment Architecture

#### IDE Environment

- Users interact directly with agent markdown files
- Agents can access all dependencies dynamically
- Supports real-time file operations and project integration
- Optimized for development workflow execution

#### Web UI Environment

- Uses pre-built bundles from `dist/teams` for stand alone 1 upload files for all agents and their assets with an orchestrating agent
- Single text files containing all agent dependencies are in `dist/agents/` - these are unnecessary unless you want to create a web agent that is only a single agent and not a team
- Created by the web-builder tool for upload to web interfaces
- Provides complete context in one package

### Template Processing System

BMad employs a sophisticated template system with three key components:

1. **Template Format** (`utils/bmad-doc-template.md`): Defines markup language for variable substitution and AI processing directives from yaml templates
2. **Document Creation** (`tasks/create-doc.md`): Orchestrates template selection and user interaction to transform yaml spec to final markdown output
3. **Advanced Elicitation** (`tasks/advanced-elicitation.md`): Provides interactive refinement through structured brainstorming

### Technical Preferences Integration

The framework includes two key preference files:

**`technical-preferences.md`** - Technology choices and patterns:
- Ensures consistency across all agents and projects
- Eliminates repetitive technology specification
- Provides personalized recommendations aligned with user preferences
- Evolves over time with lessons learned

**`project-scaffolding-preference.md`** - Project structure and organization:
- Defines standard directory structure for all projects
- Provides technology-agnostic scaffolding guidelines
- Ensures consistency in documentation organization
- Supports BMAD-specific structures (Memory Bank, ADRs, Dev Journals)

### Build and Delivery Process

The `web-builder.js` tool creates web-ready bundles by:

1. Reading agent or team definition files
2. Recursively resolving all dependencies
3. Concatenating content into single text files with clear separators
4. Outputting ready-to-upload bundles for web AI interfaces

This architecture enables seamless operation across environments while maintaining the rich, interconnected agent ecosystem that makes BMad powerful.

## Complete Development Workflow

### Planning Phase (Web UI Recommended - Especially Gemini!)

**Ideal for cost efficiency with Gemini's massive context:**

**For Brownfield Projects - Start Here!**:

1. **Upload entire project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Document existing system**: `/analyst` → `*document-project`
3. **Creates comprehensive docs** from entire codebase analysis

**For All Projects**:

1. **Optional Analysis**: `/analyst` - Market research, competitive analysis
2. **Project Brief**: Create foundation document (Analyst or user)
3. **PRD Creation**: `/pm create-doc prd` - Comprehensive product requirements
4. **Architecture Design**: `/architect create-doc architecture` - Technical foundation
5. **Validation & Alignment**: `/po` run master checklist to ensure document consistency
6. **Document Preparation**: Copy final documents to project as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`

#### Example Planning Prompts

**For PRD Creation**:

```text
"I want to build a [type] application that [core purpose].
Help me brainstorm features and create a comprehensive PRD."
```

**For Architecture Design**:

```text
"Based on this PRD, design a scalable technical architecture
that can handle [specific requirements]."
```

### Critical Transition: Web UI to IDE

**Once planning is complete, you MUST switch to IDE for development:**

- **Why**: Development workflow requires file operations, real-time project integration, and document sharding
- **Cost Benefit**: Web UI is more cost-effective for large document creation; IDE is optimized for development tasks
- **Required Files**: Ensure `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md` exist in your project

### IDE Development Workflow

**Prerequisites**: Planning documents must exist in `docs/` folder

1. **Document Sharding** (CRITICAL STEP):
   - Documents created by PM/Architect (in Web or IDE) MUST be sharded for development
   - Two methods to shard:
     a) **Manual**: Drag `shard-doc` task + document file into chat
     b) **Agent**: Ask `@bmad-master` or `@po` to shard documents
   - Shards `docs/prd.md` → `docs/prd/` folder
   - Shards `docs/architecture.md` → `docs/architecture/` folder
   - **WARNING**: Do NOT shard in Web UI - copying many small files is painful!

2. **Verify Sharded Content**:
   - At least one `epic-n.md` file in `docs/prd/` with stories in development order
   - Source tree document and coding standards for dev agent reference
   - Sharded docs for SM agent story creation

Resulting Folder Structure:

- `docs/prd/` - Broken down PRD sections
- `docs/architecture/` - Broken down architecture sections
- `docs/stories/` - Generated user stories

1. **Development Cycle** (Sequential, one story at a time):

   **CRITICAL CONTEXT MANAGEMENT**:
   - **Context windows matter!** Always use fresh, clean context windows
   - **Model selection matters!** Use most powerful thinking model for SM story creation
   - **ALWAYS start new chat between SM, Dev, and QA work**

   **Step 1 - Story Creation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → Select powerful model → `@sm` → `*create`
   - SM executes create-next-story task
   - Review generated story in `docs/stories/`
   - Update status from "Draft" to "Approved"

   **Step 2 - Story Implementation**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `@dev`
   - Agent asks which story to implement
   - Include story file content to save dev agent lookup time
   - Dev follows tasks/subtasks, marking completion
   - Dev maintains File List of all changes
   - Dev marks story as "Review" when complete with all tests passing

   **Step 3 - Senior QA Review**:
   - **NEW CLEAN CHAT** → `@qa` → execute review-story task
   - QA performs senior developer code review
   - QA can refactor and improve code directly
   - QA appends results to story's QA Results section
   - If approved: Status → "Done"
   - If changes needed: Status stays "Review" with unchecked items for dev

   **Step 4 - Repeat**: Continue SM → Dev → QA cycle until all epic stories complete

**Important**: Only 1 story in progress at a time, worked sequentially until all epic stories complete.

### Status Tracking Workflow

Stories progress through defined statuses:

- **Draft** → **Approved** → **InProgress** → **Done**

Each status change requires user verification and approval before proceeding.

### Workflow Types

#### Greenfield Development

- Business analysis and market research
- Product requirements and feature definition  
- System architecture and design
- Development execution
- Testing and deployment

#### Brownfield Enhancement (Existing Projects)

**Key Concept**: Brownfield development requires comprehensive documentation of your existing project for AI agents to understand context, patterns, and constraints.

**Complete Brownfield Workflow Options**:

**Option 1: PRD-First (Recommended for Large Codebases/Monorepos)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web** (GitHub URL, files, or zip)
2. **Create PRD first**: `@pm` → `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
3. **Focused documentation**: `@analyst` → `*document-project`
   - Analyst asks for focus if no PRD provided
   - Choose "single document" format for Web UI
   - Uses PRD to document ONLY relevant areas
   - Creates one comprehensive markdown file
   - Avoids bloating docs with unused code

**Option 2: Document-First (Good for Smaller Projects)**:

1. **Upload project to Gemini Web**
2. **Document everything**: `@analyst` → `*document-project`
3. **Then create PRD**: `@pm` → `*create-doc brownfield-prd`
   - More thorough but can create excessive documentation

4. **Requirements Gathering**:
   - **Brownfield PRD**: Use PM agent with `brownfield-prd-tmpl`
   - **Analyzes**: Existing system, constraints, integration points
   - **Defines**: Enhancement scope, compatibility requirements, risk assessment
   - **Creates**: Epic and story structure for changes

5. **Architecture Planning**:
   - **Brownfield Architecture**: Use Architect agent with `brownfield-architecture-tmpl`
   - **Integration Strategy**: How new features integrate with existing system
   - **Migration Planning**: Gradual rollout and backwards compatibility
   - **Risk Mitigation**: Addressing potential breaking changes

**Brownfield-Specific Resources**:

**Templates**:

- `brownfield-prd-tmpl.md`: Comprehensive enhancement planning with existing system analysis
- `brownfield-architecture-tmpl.md`: Integration-focused architecture for existing systems

**Tasks**:

- `document-project`: Generates comprehensive documentation from existing codebase
- `brownfield-create-epic`: Creates single epic for focused enhancements (when full PRD is overkill)
- `brownfield-create-story`: Creates individual story for small, isolated changes

**When to Use Each Approach**:

**Full Brownfield Workflow** (Recommended for):

- Major feature additions
- System modernization
- Complex integrations
- Multiple related changes

**Quick Epic/Story Creation** (Use when):

- Single, focused enhancement
- Isolated bug fixes
- Small feature additions
- Well-documented existing system

**Critical Success Factors**:

1. **Documentation First**: Always run `document-project` if docs are outdated/missing
2. **Context Matters**: Provide agents access to relevant code sections
3. **Integration Focus**: Emphasize compatibility and non-breaking changes
4. **Incremental Approach**: Plan for gradual rollout and testing

**For detailed guide**: See `docs/working-in-the-brownfield.md`

## Document Creation Best Practices

### Required File Naming for Framework Integration

- `docs/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `docs/architecture.md` - System Architecture Document

**Why These Names Matter**:

- Agents automatically reference these files during development
- Sharding tasks expect these specific filenames
- Workflow automation depends on standard naming

### Cost-Effective Document Creation Workflow

**Recommended for Large Documents (PRD, Architecture):**

1. **Use Web UI**: Create documents in web interface for cost efficiency
2. **Copy Final Output**: Save complete markdown to your project
3. **Standard Names**: Save as `docs/prd.md` and `docs/architecture.md`
4. **Switch to IDE**: Use IDE agents for development and smaller documents

### Document Sharding

Templates with Level 2 headings (`##`) can be automatically sharded:

**Original PRD**:

```markdown
## Goals and Background Context
## Requirements  
## User Interface Design Goals
## Success Metrics
```

**After Sharding**:

- `docs/prd/goals-and-background-context.md`
- `docs/prd/requirements.md`
- `docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md`
- `docs/prd/success-metrics.md`

Use the `shard-doc` task or `@kayvan/markdown-tree-parser` tool for automatic sharding.

## Usage Patterns and Best Practices

### Environment-Specific Usage

**Web UI Best For**:

- Initial planning and documentation phases
- Cost-effective large document creation
- Agent consultation and brainstorming
- Multi-agent workflows with orchestrator

**IDE Best For**:

# Twelve-Factor App Principles

> **Purpose:** This document provides the definitive set of rules based on the Twelve-Factor App methodology. These principles are mandatory for ensuring applications are built as scalable, resilient, and maintainable cloud-native services.

## The Twelve Factors

### I. Codebase
- A single, version-controlled codebase must represent one application
- All code for a specific application belongs to this single codebase
- Shared functionality must be factored into versioned libraries
- One codebase produces multiple deploys (development, staging, production)

### II. Dependencies
- Explicitly declare all dependencies via manifest files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt)
- Never rely on implicit existence of system-wide packages
- Application must run in isolated environment with only declared dependencies

### III. Config
- Strict separation between code and configuration
- All deploy-varying config must be read from environment variables
- Never hardcode environment-specific values in source code
- Codebase must be runnable anywhere with correct environment variables

### IV. Backing Services
- Treat all backing services as attached, swappable resources
- Connect via locators/credentials stored in environment variables
- Code must be agnostic to whether service is local or third-party
- Examples: databases, message queues, caches, external APIs

### V. Build, Release, Run
Maintain strict three-stage separation:
- **Build:** Convert code repo into executable bundle
- **Release:** Combine build with environment-specific config
- **Run:** Execute release in target environment
- Releases must be immutable with unique IDs
- Any change requires new release

### VI. Processes
- Execute as stateless, share-nothing processes
- Persistent data must be stored in stateful backing service
- Never assume local memory/disk state available across requests
- Process state is ephemeral

### VII. Port Binding
- Application must be self-contained
- Export services by binding to port specified via configuration
- Do not rely on runtime injection of webserver
- Application brings its own webserver library

### VIII. Concurrency
- Scale out horizontally by adding concurrent processes
- Assign different workload types to different process types
- Use process manager for lifecycle management
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start

### IX. Disposability
- Processes must be disposable (start/stop quickly)
- Minimize startup time for fast elastic scaling
- Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM
- Robust against sudden death (crash-only design)

### X. Dev/Prod Parity
Keep environments as similar as possible:
- Same programming language versions
- Same system tooling
- Same backing service types and versions
- Minimize time, personnel, and tool gaps

### XI. Logs
- Treat logs as event streams
- Never write to or manage log files directly
- Write unbuffered to stdout
- Execution environment handles collection and routing

### XII. Admin Processes
- Run admin tasks as one-off processes
- Use identical environment as long-running processes
- Ship admin scripts with application code
- Use same dependency and config management

## Additional Cloud-Native Principles

### Containerization
- **[SVC] Service as Container:** Package services as container images
- Encapsulate technology stack in containers
- Ensure consistent deployment across environments

### Serverless Options
- **[SRL] Serverless Deployment:** Consider serverless platforms when appropriate
- Abstract away infrastructure management
- Focus on business logic over infrastructure

### Observability
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and metrics
- Use distributed tracing for microservices
- Ensure all services are observable by default

### Security
- Security must be built-in, not bolted-on
- Use principle of least privilege
- Implement defense in depth
- Regular security audits and updates

## AI/Agent Safeguards
- All AI-generated code must be reviewed before production
- Escalate ambiguous or risky decisions for approval
- Log all significant AI-suggested changes
- Never overwrite .env files without confirmation

## Environmental Sustainability
- Optimize compute resources
- Minimize infrastructure waste
- Prefer energy-efficient solutions
- Consider environmental impact in technical decisions

## Integration with BMAD

These principles should be:
1. Applied during architecture design
2. Validated during implementation
3. Enforced through CI/CD pipelines
4. Reviewed during architectural decision records (ADRs)
5. Considered in all technical decisions

# Microservice Architecture Patterns

> **Purpose:** This document outlines specific patterns and strategies for implementing Microservice-Oriented Architecture, based on Chris Richardson's "Microservices Patterns". It provides detailed guidance for service design, decomposition, communication, and data management.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### Foundation Patterns
- **[MON] Monolithic Architecture:** Single deployable unit. Good for simple applications, becomes "monolithic hell" as complexity grows.
- **[MSA] Microservice Architecture:** Collection of small, autonomous, loosely coupled services. Core pattern for complex systems.

### Service Decomposition
- **[DBC] Decompose by Business Capability:** Define services based on business capabilities (e.g., Order Management, Inventory).
- **[DSD] Decompose by Subdomain:** Use Domain-Driven Design to define services around problem subdomains.

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- **[RPI] Remote Procedure Invocation:** Synchronous request/response (REST, gRPC). Simple but creates coupling.
- **[CBR] Circuit Breaker:** Prevent cascading failures. Trip after consecutive failures, fail fast.

### Asynchronous Communication
- **[MSG] Messaging:** Services communicate via message broker. Promotes loose coupling and resilience.
- **[DME] Domain Events:** Aggregates publish events when state changes. Foundation for event-driven architecture.

### Service Discovery
- **[SDC] Service Discovery:** Patterns for finding service instances in dynamic cloud environments:
  - Client-side discovery
  - Server-side discovery
  - Service registry patterns

## Data Management Patterns

### Data Architecture
- **[DPS] Database per Service:** Each service owns its data. Fundamental to loose coupling.
- **[AGG] Aggregate:** Cluster of domain objects as single unit. Transactions only create/update single aggregate.

### Data Consistency
- **[SAG] Saga:** Manage data consistency across services without distributed transactions:
  - Sequence of local transactions
  - Event/message triggered
  - Compensating transactions on failure

### Event Patterns
- **[EVS] Event Sourcing:** Store state-changing events rather than current state. Provides audit log.
- **[OUT] Transactional Outbox:** Reliably publish messages as part of local database transaction.

### Query Patterns
- **[APC] API Composition:** Client retrieves and joins data from multiple services. Simple but inefficient for complex queries.
- **[CQR] CQRS:** Separate command (write) and query (read) models. Maintain denormalized read views.

## API Patterns

### Gateway Patterns
- **[APG] API Gateway:** Single entry point for all clients. Routes requests, handles cross-cutting concerns.
- **[BFF] Backends for Frontends:** Separate API gateway for each client type (mobile, web).

## Domain Modeling

### Design Approaches
- **[DOM] Domain Model:** Object-oriented with state and behavior. Preferred for complex logic.
- **[TSF] Transaction Script:** Procedural approach. Simpler but unmanageable for complex logic.

## Testing Patterns

### Service Testing
- **[CDC] Consumer-Driven Contract Test:** Consumer writes tests to verify provider meets expectations.
- **[SCT] Service Component Test:** Acceptance test for single service with stubbed dependencies.

## Deployment Patterns

### Container Patterns
- **[SVC] Service as Container:** Package service as container image to encapsulate technology stack.
- **[SRL] Serverless Deployment:** Deploy using serverless platform (e.g., AWS Lambda).

### Infrastructure Patterns
- **[MSC] Microservice Chassis:** Framework handling cross-cutting concerns (config, health, metrics).
- **[SMH] Service Mesh:** Infrastructure layer for inter-service communication (Istio, Linkerd).

## Migration Patterns

### Legacy Modernization
- **[STR] Strangler Application:** Incrementally build microservices around monolith. Gradual replacement.

## Best Practices

### Service Design
1. Services should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive
2. Own their data and business logic
3. Communicate through well-defined interfaces
4. Be independently deployable

### Transaction Management
1. Avoid distributed transactions
2. Use saga pattern for cross-service consistency
3. Design for eventual consistency
4. Implement idempotency

### Resilience
1. Implement circuit breakers
2. Use timeouts and retries wisely
3. Design for failure
4. Implement health checks

### Observability
1. Distributed tracing across services
2. Centralized logging
3. Service-level metrics
4. Business metrics

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Distributed Monolith:** Microservices that must be deployed together
2. **Chatty Services:** Excessive inter-service communication
3. **Shared Database:** Multiple services accessing same database
4. **Synchronous Communication Everywhere:** Over-reliance on RPI
5. **Missing Service Boundaries:** Services that don't align with business capabilities

## Integration with BMAD

These patterns should be:
1. Considered during architecture design phase
2. Documented in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
3. Applied based on specific project requirements
4. Validated against twelve-factor principles
5. Reviewed for applicability to project scale and complexity

# Workflow Management

Enables BMad orchestrator to manage and execute team workflows.

## Dynamic Workflow Loading

Read available workflows from current team configuration's `workflows` field. Each team bundle defines its own supported workflows.

**Key Commands**:

- `/workflows` - List workflows in current bundle or workflows folder
- `/agent-list` - Show agents in current bundle

## Workflow Commands

### /workflows

Lists available workflows with titles and descriptions.

### /workflow-start {workflow-id}

Starts workflow and transitions to first agent.

### /workflow-status

Shows current progress, completed artifacts, and next steps.

### /workflow-resume

Resumes workflow from last position. User can provide completed artifacts.

### /workflow-next

Shows next recommended agent and action.

## Execution Flow

1. **Starting**: Load definition → Identify first stage → Transition to agent → Guide artifact creation

2. **Stage Transitions**: Mark complete → Check conditions → Load next agent → Pass artifacts

3. **Artifact Tracking**: Track status, creator, timestamps in workflow_state

4. **Interruption Handling**: Analyze provided artifacts → Determine position → Suggest next step

## Context Passing

When transitioning, pass:

- Previous artifacts
- Current workflow stage
- Expected outputs
- Decisions/constraints

## Multi-Path Workflows

Handle conditional paths by asking clarifying questions when needed.

## Best Practices

1. Show progress
2. Explain transitions
3. Preserve context
4. Allow flexibility
5. Track state

## Agent Integration

Agents should be workflow-aware: know active workflow, their role, access artifacts, understand expected outputs.
