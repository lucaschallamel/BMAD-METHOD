# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-core/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-core/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

4. **Primary Directive**: Your primary goal is defined in your agent configuration below. Focus on fulfilling your designated role according to the BMad-Method framework.

# Create Next Story Task

## Purpose

To identify the next logical story based on project progress and epic definitions, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable story file using the `Story Template`. This task ensures the story is enriched with all necessary technical context, requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research or finding its own context.

## Prerequisites

Before creating stories, ensure proper session context:
- **Session Kickoff**: If this is a new session or after significant time gap (>24 hours), first run the `session-kickoff` task to establish complete project context
- **Memory Bank**: Verify Memory Bank files are current for accurate story creation

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow

- Load `.bmad-core/core-config.yaml` from the project root
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation. You can either: 1) Copy it from GITHUB bmad-core/core-config.yaml and configure it for your project OR 2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically. Please add and configure core-config.yaml before proceeding."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`, `workflow.*`

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

#### 1.1 Locate Epic Files and Review Existing Stories

- Based on `prdSharded` from config, locate epic files (sharded location/pattern or monolithic PRD sections)
- If `devStoryLocation` has story files, load the highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
- **If highest story exists:**
  - Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"
  - If proceeding, select next sequential story in the current epic
  - If epic is complete, prompt user: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic. User MUST explicitly instruct which story to create.
- **If no story files exist:** The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}"

### 2. Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context

- Extract story requirements from the identified epic file
- If previous story exists, review Dev Agent Record sections for:
  - Completion Notes and Debug Log References
  - Implementation deviations and technical decisions
  - Challenges encountered and lessons learned
- Extract relevant insights that inform the current story's preparation

### 3. Gather Architecture Context

#### 3.1 Determine Architecture Reading Strategy

- **If `architectureVersion: >= v4` and `architectureSharded: true`**: Read `{architectureShardedLocation}/index.md` then follow structured reading order below
- **Else**: Use monolithic `architectureFile` for similar sections

#### 3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type

**For ALL Stories:** tech-stack.md, unified-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, testing-strategy.md

**For Backend/API Stories, additionally:** data-models.md, database-schema.md, backend-architecture.md, rest-api-spec.md, external-apis.md

**For Frontend/UI Stories, additionally:** frontend-architecture.md, components.md, core-workflows.md, data-models.md

**For Full-Stack Stories:** Read both Backend and Frontend sections above

#### 3.3 Extract Story-Specific Technical Details

Extract ONLY information directly relevant to implementing the current story. Do NOT invent new libraries, patterns, or standards not in the source documents.

Extract:

- Specific data models, schemas, or structures the story will use
- API endpoints the story must implement or consume
- Component specifications for UI elements in the story
- File paths and naming conventions for new code
- Testing requirements specific to the story's features
- Security or performance considerations affecting the story

ALWAYS cite source documents: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

### 4. Verify Project Structure Alignment

- Cross-reference story requirements with Project Structure Guide from `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`
- Ensure file paths, component locations, or module names align with defined structures
- Document any structural conflicts in "Project Structure Notes" section within the story draft

### 5. Populate Story Template with Full Context

- Create new story file: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` using Story Template
- Fill in basic story information: Title, Status (Draft), Story statement, Acceptance Criteria from Epic
- **`Dev Notes` section (CRITICAL):**
  - CRITICAL: This section MUST contain ONLY information extracted from architecture documents. NEVER invent or assume technical details.
  - Include ALL relevant technical details from Steps 2-3, organized by category:
    - **Previous Story Insights**: Key learnings from previous story
    - **Data Models**: Specific schemas, validation rules, relationships [with source references]
    - **API Specifications**: Endpoint details, request/response formats, auth requirements [with source references]
    - **Component Specifications**: UI component details, props, state management [with source references]
    - **File Locations**: Exact paths where new code should be created based on project structure
    - **Testing Requirements**: Specific test cases or strategies from testing-strategy.md
    - **Technical Constraints**: Version requirements, performance considerations, security rules
  - Every technical detail MUST include its source reference: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`
  - If information for a category is not found in the architecture docs, explicitly state: "No specific guidance found in architecture docs"
- **`Tasks / Subtasks` section:**
  - Generate detailed, sequential list of technical tasks based ONLY on: Epic Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed Architecture Information
  - Each task must reference relevant architecture documentation
  - Include unit testing as explicit subtasks based on the Testing Strategy
  - Link tasks to ACs where applicable (e.g., `Task 1 (AC: 1, 3)`)
- Add notes on project structure alignment or discrepancies found in Step 4

### 6. Story Draft Completion and Review

- Review all sections for completeness and accuracy
- Verify all source references are included for technical details
- Ensure tasks align with both epic requirements and architecture constraints
- Update status to "Draft" and save the story file
- Execute `.bmad-core/tasks/execute-checklist` `.bmad-core/checklists/story-draft-checklist`
- Provide summary to user including:
  - Story created: `{devStoryLocation}/{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md`
  - Status: Draft
  - Key technical components included from architecture docs
  - Any deviations or conflicts noted between epic and architecture
  - Checklist Results
  - Next steps: For Complex stories, suggest the user carefully review the story draft and also optionally have the PO run the task `.bmad-core/tasks/validate-next-story`

# Checklist Validation Task

This task provides instructions for validating documentation against checklists. The agent MUST follow these instructions to ensure thorough and systematic validation of documents.

## Available Checklists

If the user asks or does not specify a specific checklist, list the checklists available to the agent persona. If the task is being run not with a specific agent, tell the user to check the .bmad-core/checklists folder to select the appropriate one to run.

## Instructions

1. **Initial Assessment**

   - If user or the task being run provides a checklist name:
     - Try fuzzy matching (e.g. "architecture checklist" -> "architect-checklist")
     - If multiple matches found, ask user to clarify
     - Load the appropriate checklist from .bmad-core/checklists/
   - If no checklist specified:
     - Ask the user which checklist they want to use
     - Present the available options from the files in the checklists folder
   - Confirm if they want to work through the checklist:
     - Section by section (interactive mode - very time consuming)
     - All at once (YOLO mode - recommended for checklists, there will be a summary of sections at the end to discuss)

2. **Document and Artifact Gathering**

   - Each checklist will specify its required documents/artifacts at the beginning
   - Follow the checklist's specific instructions for what to gather, generally a file can be resolved in the docs folder, if not or unsure, halt and ask or confirm with the user.

3. **Checklist Processing**

   If in interactive mode:

   - Work through each section of the checklist one at a time
   - For each section:
     - Review all items in the section following instructions for that section embedded in the checklist
     - Check each item against the relevant documentation or artifacts as appropriate
     - Present summary of findings for that section, highlighting warnings, errors and non applicable items (rationale for non-applicability).
     - Get user confirmation before proceeding to next section or if any thing major do we need to halt and take corrective action

   If in YOLO mode:

   - Process all sections at once
   - Create a comprehensive report of all findings
   - Present the complete analysis to the user

4. **Validation Approach**

   For each checklist item:

   - Read and understand the requirement
   - Look for evidence in the documentation that satisfies the requirement
   - Consider both explicit mentions and implicit coverage
   - Aside from this, follow all checklist llm instructions
   - Mark items as:
     - ✅ PASS: Requirement clearly met
     - ❌ FAIL: Requirement not met or insufficient coverage
     - ⚠️ PARTIAL: Some aspects covered but needs improvement
     - N/A: Not applicable to this case

5. **Section Analysis**

   For each section:

   - think step by step to calculate pass rate
   - Identify common themes in failed items
   - Provide specific recommendations for improvement
   - In interactive mode, discuss findings with user
   - Document any user decisions or explanations

6. **Final Report**

   Prepare a summary that includes:

   - Overall checklist completion status
   - Pass rates by section
   - List of failed items with context
   - Specific recommendations for improvement
   - Any sections or items marked as N/A with justification

## Checklist Execution Methodology

Each checklist now contains embedded LLM prompts and instructions that will:

1. **Guide thorough thinking** - Prompts ensure deep analysis of each section
2. **Request specific artifacts** - Clear instructions on what documents/access is needed
3. **Provide contextual guidance** - Section-specific prompts for better validation
4. **Generate comprehensive reports** - Final summary with detailed findings

The LLM will:

- Execute the complete checklist validation
- Present a final report with pass/fail rates and key findings
- Offer to provide detailed analysis of any section, especially those with warnings or failures

==================== START: .bmad-core/tasks/correct-course.md ====================
# Correct Course Task

## Purpose

- Guide a structured response to a change trigger using the `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`.
- Analyze the impacts of the change on epics, project artifacts, and the MVP, guided by the checklist's structure.
- Explore potential solutions (e.g., adjust scope, rollback elements, re-scope features) as prompted by the checklist.
- Draft specific, actionable proposed updates to any affected project artifacts (e.g., epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document sections) based on the analysis.
- Produce a consolidated "Sprint Change Proposal" document that contains the impact analysis and the clearly drafted proposed edits for user review and approval.
- Ensure a clear handoff path if the nature of the changes necessitates fundamental replanning by other core agents (like PM or Architect).

## Instructions

### 1. Initial Setup & Mode Selection

- **Acknowledge Task & Inputs:**
  - Confirm with the user that the "Correct Course Task" (Change Navigation & Integration) is being initiated.
  - Verify the change trigger and ensure you have the user's initial explanation of the issue and its perceived impact.
  - Confirm access to all relevant project artifacts (e.g., PRD, Epics/Stories, Architecture Documents, UI/UX Specifications) and, critically, the `.bmad-core/checklists/change-checklist`.
- **Establish Interaction Mode:**
  - Ask the user their preferred interaction mode for this task:
    - **"Incrementally (Default & Recommended):** Shall we work through the change-checklist section by section, discussing findings and collaboratively drafting proposed changes for each relevant part before moving to the next? This allows for detailed, step-by-step refinement."
    - **"YOLO Mode (Batch Processing):** Or, would you prefer I conduct a more batched analysis based on the checklist and then present a consolidated set of findings and proposed changes for a broader review? This can be quicker for initial assessment but might require more extensive review of the combined proposals."
  - Once the user chooses, confirm the selected mode and then inform the user: "We will now use the change-checklist to analyze the change and draft proposed updates. I will guide you through the checklist items based on our chosen interaction mode."

### 2. Execute Checklist Analysis (Iteratively or Batched, per Interaction Mode)

- Systematically work through Sections 1-4 of the change-checklist (typically covering Change Context, Epic/Story Impact Analysis, Artifact Conflict Resolution, and Path Evaluation/Recommendation).
- For each checklist item or logical group of items (depending on interaction mode):
  - Present the relevant prompt(s) or considerations from the checklist to the user.
  - Request necessary information and actively analyze the relevant project artifacts (PRD, epics, architecture documents, story history, etc.) to assess the impact.
  - Discuss your findings for each item with the user.
  - Record the status of each checklist item (e.g., `[x] Addressed`, `[N/A]`, `[!] Further Action Needed`) and any pertinent notes or decisions.
  - Collaboratively agree on the "Recommended Path Forward" as prompted by Section 4 of the checklist.

### 3. Draft Proposed Changes (Iteratively or Batched)

- Based on the completed checklist analysis (Sections 1-4) and the agreed "Recommended Path Forward" (excluding scenarios requiring fundamental replans that would necessitate immediate handoff to PM/Architect):
  - Identify the specific project artifacts that require updates (e.g., specific epics, user stories, PRD sections, architecture document components, diagrams).
  - **Draft the proposed changes directly and explicitly for each identified artifact.** Examples include:
    - Revising user story text, acceptance criteria, or priority.
    - Adding, removing, reordering, or splitting user stories within epics.
    - Proposing modified architecture diagram snippets (e.g., providing an updated Mermaid diagram block or a clear textual description of the change to an existing diagram).
    - Updating technology lists, configuration details, or specific sections within the PRD or architecture documents.
    - Drafting new, small supporting artifacts if necessary (e.g., a brief addendum for a specific decision).
  - If in "Incremental Mode," discuss and refine these proposed edits for each artifact or small group of related artifacts with the user as they are drafted.
  - If in "YOLO Mode," compile all drafted edits for presentation in the next step.

### 4. Generate "Sprint Change Proposal" with Edits

- Synthesize the complete change-checklist analysis (covering findings from Sections 1-4) and all the agreed-upon proposed edits (from Instruction 3) into a single document titled "Sprint Change Proposal." This proposal should align with the structure suggested by Section 5 of the change-checklist.
- The proposal must clearly present:
  - **Analysis Summary:** A concise overview of the original issue, its analyzed impact (on epics, artifacts, MVP scope), and the rationale for the chosen path forward.
  - **Specific Proposed Edits:** For each affected artifact, clearly show or describe the exact changes (e.g., "Change Story X.Y from: [old text] To: [new text]", "Add new Acceptance Criterion to Story A.B: [new AC]", "Update Section 3.2 of Architecture Document as follows: [new/modified text or diagram description]").
- Present the complete draft of the "Sprint Change Proposal" to the user for final review and feedback. Incorporate any final adjustments requested by the user.

### 5. Finalize & Determine Next Steps

- Obtain explicit user approval for the "Sprint Change Proposal," including all the specific edits documented within it.
- Provide the finalized "Sprint Change Proposal" document to the user.
- **Based on the nature of the approved changes:**
  - **If the approved edits sufficiently address the change and can be implemented directly or organized by a PO/SM:** State that the "Correct Course Task" is complete regarding analysis and change proposal, and the user can now proceed with implementing or logging these changes (e.g., updating actual project documents, backlog items). Suggest handoff to a PO/SM agent for backlog organization if appropriate.
  - **If the analysis and proposed path (as per checklist Section 4 and potentially Section 6) indicate that the change requires a more fundamental replan (e.g., significant scope change, major architectural rework):** Clearly state this conclusion. Advise the user that the next step involves engaging the primary PM or Architect agents, using the "Sprint Change Proposal" as critical input and context for that deeper replanning effort.

## Output Deliverables

- **Primary:** A "Sprint Change Proposal" document (in markdown format). This document will contain:
  - A summary of the change-checklist analysis (issue, impact, rationale for the chosen path).
  - Specific, clearly drafted proposed edits for all affected project artifacts.
- **Implicit:** An annotated change-checklist (or the record of its completion) reflecting the discussions, findings, and decisions made during the process.

- **Current Phase**: [Development stage]
- **Last Updated**: [When Memory Bank was last updated]

## Documentation Health
- **Memory Bank**: [Exists/Missing/Outdated]
- **Architecture Docs**: [Current/Needs Update]
- **Dev Journals**: [Last entry date]
- **ADRs**: [Recent decisions noted]

## Current State
- **Active Branch**: [Git branch]
- **Recent Work**: [Summary from dev journals]
- **Project Health**: [Green/Yellow/Red with reasons]
- **Immediate Blockers**: [Any urgent issues]

## Inconsistencies Found
[List any documentation inconsistencies or gaps]

## Agent-Specific Context
[Relevant context for current agent role]

## Recommended Next Steps
1. [Most urgent priority]
2. [Secondary priority]
3. [Documentation updates needed]
```

## Integration Points

This task integrates with:
- **Memory Bank**: Primary source of project context
- **All Agents**: Universal session initialization
- **Document Project**: Can trigger if documentation missing
- **Update Memory Bank**: Can trigger if information outdated
- **Agent Activation**: Called at start of agent sessions

## Usage Patterns

**New Agent Session**:
1. Agent activates
2. Runs `session-kickoff` task
3. Reviews output and confirms understanding
4. Proceeds with informed context

**Project Handoff**:
1. New team member or AI session
2. Runs comprehensive kickoff
3. Identifies knowledge gaps
4. Updates documentation as needed

**Quality Gate**:
1. Before major feature work
2. After significant time gap
3. When context seems incomplete
4. As part of regular project health checks

## Notes

- This task should be lightweight for daily use but comprehensive for major handoffs
- Adapt depth based on project complexity and available time
- Can be automated as part of agent startup routines
- Helps prevent tunnel vision and context loss

# Update Memory Bank

This task updates the Memory Bank documentation based on recent project activities. The Memory Bank ensures AI agents maintain context across sessions by preserving project knowledge in structured files.

## Purpose

Update the Memory Bank to reflect:
- Recent development activities and decisions
- Architectural changes and patterns
- Technical context updates
- Progress and current work state
- Lessons learned and insights

## Data Sources

The update draws from multiple sources:
- **Dev Journal Entries**: Daily development narratives in `docs/devJournal/`
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Recent changes and version history
- **README Files**: Project documentation updates
- **ADRs**: Architectural Decision Records in `docs/adr/`
- **Source Code**: Actual implementation changes
- **Test Results**: Quality and coverage updates

## Update Process

### 1. Gather Recent Changes

```bash
# Review dev journals from recent sessions
ls -la docs/devJournal/*.md | tail -5

# Check recent ADRs
ls -la docs/adr/*.md | tail -5

# Review CHANGELOG
head -50 CHANGELOG.md

# Check README updates
find . -name "README*.md" -mtime -7
```

### 2. Analyze Impact

For each source, identify:
- What changed and why
- Impact on system architecture
- New patterns or conventions
- Technical decisions made
- Open questions resolved
- New dependencies or constraints

### 3. Update Memory Bank Files

Update relevant files based on changes:

#### 3.1 Project Brief (`projectbrief.md`)
Update if:
- Core requirements changed
- Project goals refined
- Success criteria modified
- New constraints identified

#### 3.2 Product Context (`productContext.md`)
Update if:
- User needs clarified
- Problem understanding evolved
- Expected outcomes changed
- UX goals modified

#### 3.3 System Patterns (`systemPatterns.md`)
Update if:
- Architecture decisions made (check ADRs)
- New design patterns adopted
- Component relationships changed
- Integration points modified
- Critical paths identified

#### 3.4 Tech Context (`techContext.md`)
Update if:
- Dependencies added/updated
- Tools or frameworks changed
- Build process modified
- Technical constraints discovered
- Environment changes

#### 3.5 Active Context (`activeContext.md`)
ALWAYS update with:
- Current work items
- Recent completions
- Active decisions
- Next priorities
- Open questions
- Important patterns discovered
- Learnings from dev journals

#### 3.6 Progress (`progress.md`)
Update with:
- Features completed
- Work in progress status
- Issues discovered/resolved
- Technical debt changes
- Decision evolution

### 4. Validation

After updates:
1. **Cross-Reference Check**: Ensure consistency across all files
2. **Accuracy Verification**: Confirm updates match source material
3. **Completeness Review**: No critical information omitted
4. **Clarity Assessment**: Clear for future AI sessions

### 5. Update Guidelines

- **Be Concise**: Capture essence without excessive detail
- **Be Comprehensive**: Include all significant changes
- **Be Accurate**: Reflect actual state, not aspirations
- **Maintain Consistency**: Align with existing memory bank content
- **Use British English**: For consistency across documentation

## Selective vs Comprehensive Updates

### Selective Update
Triggered by specific events:
- Story completion → Update progress and activeContext
- ADR creation → Update systemPatterns
- Major decision → Update relevant sections
- Architecture change → Update systemPatterns and techContext

### Comprehensive Update
Triggered by:
- End of sprint/iteration
- Major milestone reached
- Explicit user request
- Significant project pivot
- Before major feature work

**Sprint Review Integration**: For sprint-end updates, use the `sprint-review-checklist.md` to ensure all sprint accomplishments, learnings, and technical decisions are captured in the Memory Bank.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] All recent dev journals reviewed
- [ ] ADRs incorporated into systemPatterns
- [ ] CHANGELOG reflected in progress
- [ ] Active work items current
- [ ] Technical decisions documented
- [ ] No contradictions between files
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined
- [ ] British English used throughout

## Integration Points

This task integrates with:
- **Dev Journal Creation**: Triggers selective activeContext update
- **ADR Creation**: Triggers systemPatterns update
- **Story Completion**: Triggers progress update
- **Sprint End**: Triggers comprehensive update (use `sprint-review-checklist.md`)
- **Architecture Changes**: Triggers multiple file updates
- **Sprint Reviews**: Reference `sprint-review-checklist.md` to ensure comprehensive capture of sprint outcomes

## Notes

- Memory Bank is critical for AI session continuity
- Updates should capture reality, not ideals
- Focus on information that helps future sessions
- Balance detail with conciseness
- Remember: This is the AI's only link to past work after memory reset

# Story Draft Checklist

The Scrum Master should use this checklist to validate that each story contains sufficient context for a developer agent to implement it successfully, while assuming the dev agent has reasonable capabilities to figure things out.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DRAFT VALIDATION

Before proceeding with this checklist, ensure you have access to:

1. The story document being validated (usually in docs/stories/ or provided directly)
2. The parent epic context
3. Any referenced architecture or design documents
4. Previous related stories if this builds on prior work

IMPORTANT: This checklist validates individual stories BEFORE implementation begins.

VALIDATION PRINCIPLES:

1. Clarity - A developer should understand WHAT to build
2. Context - WHY this is being built and how it fits
3. Guidance - Key technical decisions and patterns to follow
4. Testability - How to verify the implementation works
5. Self-Contained - Most info needed is in the story itself

REMEMBER: We assume competent developer agents who can:

- Research documentation and codebases
- Make reasonable technical decisions
- Follow established patterns
- Ask for clarification when truly stuck

We're checking for SUFFICIENT guidance, not exhaustive detail.]]

## 1. GOAL & CONTEXT CLARITY

[[LLM: Without clear goals, developers build the wrong thing. Verify:

1. The story states WHAT functionality to implement
2. The business value or user benefit is clear
3. How this fits into the larger epic/product is explained
4. Dependencies are explicit ("requires Story X to be complete")
5. Success looks like something specific, not vague
6. Memory Bank context has been considered
7. Technical principles alignment is clear]]

- [ ] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [ ] Relationship to epic goals is evident
- [ ] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [ ] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (if applicable)
- [ ] Business context and value are clear
- [ ] Memory Bank context referenced where relevant
- [ ] Technical principles and preferences considered

## 2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Developers need enough technical context to start coding. Check:

1. Key files/components to create or modify are mentioned
2. Technology choices are specified where non-obvious
3. Integration points with existing code are identified
4. Data models or API contracts are defined or referenced
5. Non-standard patterns or exceptions are called out

Note: We don't need every file listed - just the important ones.]]

- [ ] Key files to create/modify are identified (not necessarily exhaustive)
- [ ] Technologies specifically needed for this story are mentioned
- [ ] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described
- [ ] Necessary data models or structures are referenced
- [ ] Required environment variables are listed (if applicable)
- [ ] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted

## 3. REFERENCE EFFECTIVENESS

[[LLM: References should help, not create a treasure hunt. Ensure:

1. References point to specific sections, not whole documents
2. The relevance of each reference is explained
3. Critical information is summarized in the story
4. References are accessible (not broken links)
5. Previous story context is summarized if needed]]

- [ ] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [ ] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (not just referenced)
- [ ] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [ ] References use consistent format (e.g., `docs/filename.md#section`)
- [ ] ADR references included where architectural decisions apply
- [ ] Memory Bank files referenced appropriately (activeContext, systemPatterns, etc.)

## 4. SELF-CONTAINMENT ASSESSMENT

[[LLM: Stories should be mostly self-contained to avoid context switching. Verify:

1. Core requirements are in the story, not just in references
2. Domain terms are explained or obvious from context
3. Assumptions are stated explicitly
4. Edge cases are mentioned (even if deferred)
5. The story could be understood without reading 10 other documents]]

- [ ] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [ ] Implicit assumptions are made explicit
- [ ] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained
- [ ] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed

## 5. TESTING GUIDANCE

[[LLM: Testing ensures the implementation actually works. Check:

1. Test approach is specified (unit, integration, e2e)
2. Key test scenarios are listed
3. Success criteria are measurable
4. Special test considerations are noted
5. Acceptance criteria in the story are testable]]

- [ ] Required testing approach is outlined
- [ ] Key test scenarios are identified
- [ ] Success criteria are defined
- [ ] Special testing considerations are noted (if applicable)

## VALIDATION RESULT

[[LLM: FINAL STORY VALIDATION REPORT

Generate a concise validation report:

1. Quick Summary

   - Story readiness: READY / NEEDS REVISION / BLOCKED
   - Clarity score (1-10)
   - Major gaps identified

2. Fill in the validation table with:

   - PASS: Requirements clearly met
   - PARTIAL: Some gaps but workable
   - FAIL: Critical information missing

3. Specific Issues (if any)

   - List concrete problems to fix
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Identify any blocking dependencies

4. Developer Perspective
   - Could YOU implement this story as written?
   - What questions would you have?
   - What might cause delays or rework?

Be pragmatic - perfect documentation doesn't exist, but it must be enough to provide the extreme context a dev agent needs to get the work down and not create a mess.]]

| Category                             | Status | Issues |
|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | _TBD_  |        |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | _TBD_  |        |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | _TBD_  |        |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | _TBD_  |        |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | _TBD_  |        |

**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation
- NEEDS REVISION: The story requires updates (see issues)
- BLOCKED: External information required (specify what information)

# Session Kickoff Checklist

This checklist ensures AI agents have complete project context and understanding before starting work. It provides systematic session initialization across all agent types.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - SESSION KICKOFF

This is the FIRST checklist to run when starting any new AI agent session. It prevents context gaps, reduces mistakes, and ensures efficient work.

IMPORTANT: This checklist is mandatory for:
- New AI sessions on existing projects
- After significant time gaps (>24 hours)

# Sprint Review Triggers

This document outlines when and how to conduct sprint reviews within the BMAD framework.

## When to Conduct Sprint Reviews

### Regular Cadence
- **End of Sprint**: Always conduct at the conclusion of each defined sprint period
- **Weekly/Bi-weekly**: Based on your sprint duration
- **After Major Milestones**: When significant features or phases complete

### Event-Based Triggers
- **Epic Completion**: When all stories in an epic are done
- **Release Preparation**: Before any production release
- **Team Changes**: When team composition changes significantly
- **Process Issues**: When recurring blockers or challenges arise
- **Client Reviews**: Before or after stakeholder demonstrations

## Sprint Review Components

### 1. **Metrics Gathering** (Automated)
- Git commit analysis
- PR merge tracking
- Issue closure rates
- Test coverage changes
- Build/deployment success rates

### 2. **Achievement Documentation**
- Feature completions with evidence
- Technical improvements made
- Documentation updates
- Bug fixes and resolutions

### 3. **Retrospective Elements**
- What went well (celebrate successes)
- What didn't go well (identify issues)
- What we learned (capture insights)
- What we'll try next (action items)

### 4. **Memory Bank Updates**
- Update progress.md with completed features
- Update activeContext.md with current state
- Document new patterns in systemPatterns.md
- Reflect on technical decisions

## Sprint Review Best Practices

### Preparation
- Schedule review 1-2 days before sprint end
- Gather metrics using git commands beforehand
- Review dev journals from the sprint
- Prepare demo materials if applicable

### Facilitation
- Keep to 60-90 minutes maximum
- Encourage all team members to contribute
- Focus on facts and evidence
- Balance positive and improvement areas
- Make action items specific and assignable

### Documentation
- Use consistent naming: `YYYYMMDD-sprint-review.md`
- Place in `docs/devJournal/` directory
- Link to relevant PRs, issues, and commits
- Include screenshots or recordings when helpful

### Follow-up
- Assign owners to all action items
- Set deadlines for improvements
- Review previous sprint's action items
- Update project Memory Bank
- Share outcomes with stakeholders

## Integration with BMAD Workflow

### Before Sprint Review
1. Complete all story reviews
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Ensure dev journals are current
4. Close completed issues/PRs

### During Sprint Review
1. Use `*sprint-review` command as Scrum Master
2. Follow the guided template
3. Gather team input actively
4. Document honestly and thoroughly

### After Sprint Review
1. Update Memory Bank (`*update-memory-bank`)
2. Create next sprint's initial backlog
3. Communicate outcomes to stakeholders
4. Schedule action item check-ins
5. Archive sprint artifacts

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Skipping Reviews**: Even failed sprints need reviews
- **Solo Reviews**: Include the whole team when possible
- **Blame Sessions**: Focus on process, not people
- **No Action Items**: Every review should produce improvements
- **Lost Knowledge**: Always document in standard location
- **Metrics Without Context**: Numbers need interpretation

## Quick Reference

### Git Commands for Metrics
```bash
# Commits in sprint
git log --since="2024-01-01" --until="2024-01-14" --oneline | wc -l

# PRs merged
git log --merges --since="2024-01-01" --until="2024-01-14" --oneline

# Issues closed
git log --since="2024-01-01" --until="2024-01-14" --grep="close[sd]\|fixe[sd]" --oneline

# Active branches
git branch --format='%(refname:short) %(creatordate:short)' | grep '2024-01'
```
